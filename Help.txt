Colors text received over standard input based on regular expression patterns.

Usage:

    $NAME COLOR1=REGEX1 COLOR2=REGEX2 ... COLORN=REGEXN

Each line read over standard input is tested against each regular expression
pattern (REGEX) in turn. Those that match are used to highlight the matched
portion of the text in the corresponding color (COLOR). The regular
expression patterns are tested on each line only once unless a start-equal
(*=) instead just an equal (=) is used to separate the color from the regular
expression pattern specification.

A color is specified in one of three formats:

    1. FOREGROUND
    2. FOREGROUND/BACKGROUND
    3. HEX

Format 1 sets only the foreground color of the text whereas format 2 sets the
foreground and background colors (separated by a forward-slash to mean
foreground over background). The colors themselves are specified using the
names listed below .In format 3, the colors are specified by two hex digits:
the first corresponds to the background and the second the foreground. If
only hex digit is given then it sets the foreground color. The color
corresponding of each hex digits is shown below.

    0 = Black           8 = DarkGray
    1 = DarkBlue        9 = Blue
    2 = DarkGreen       A = Green
    3 = DarkCyan        B = Cyan
    4 = DarkRed         C = Red
    5 = DarkMagenta     D = Magenta
    6 = DarkYellow      E = Yellow
    7 = Gray            F = White

Below is a quick reference:

    Main Elements ------------------------------------------------------------

    text     Matches exact characters anywhere in the original text.

    .        Matches any single character.

    [chars]  Matches at least one of the characters in the brackets.

    [range]  Matches at least one of the characters within the range. The use
             of a hyphen (-) allows you to specify an adjacent character.

    [^chars] Matches any characters except those in brackets.

    ^        Matches the beginning characters.

    $        Matches the end characters.

    *        Matches any instances of the preceding character.

    ?        Matches zero or one instance of the preceding character.

    \        Matches the character that follows as an escaped character.

    Quantifiers --------------------------------------------------------------

    *        Specifies zero or more matches.

    +        Matches repeating instances of the preceding characters.

    ?        Specifies zero or one matches.

    {n}      Specifies exactly n matches.

    {n,}     Specifies at least n matches.

    {n,m}    Specifies at least n, but no more than m, matches.

    Character Classes --------------------------------------------------------

    \p{name} Matches any character in the named character class specified by
             {name}. Supported names are Unicode groups and block ranges such
             as Ll, Nd, Z, IsGreek, and IsBoxDrawing.

    \P{name} Matches text not included in the groups and block ranges
             specified in {name}.

    \w       Matches any word character. Equivalent to the Unicode character
             categories [\p{Ll} \p{Lu}\p{Lt}\p{Lo}\p{Nd}\p{Pc}].

    \W       Matches any nonword character. Equivalent to the Unicode
             categories [^\p{Ll}\p{Lu}\p{Lt} \p{Lo}\p{Nd}\p{Pc}].

    \s       Matches any white-space character. Equivalent to the Unicode
             character categories [\f\n\r\t\v\x85\p{Z}].

    \S       Matches any non-white-space character. Equivalent to the Unicode
             character categories [^\f\n\r\t\v\x85\p{Z}].

    \d       Matches any decimal digit. Equivalent to \p{Nd} for Unicode and
             [0-9] for non-Unicode behavior.

    \D       Matches any nondigit. Equivalent  to \P{Nd} for Unicode and
             [^0-9] for non-Unicode behavior.
